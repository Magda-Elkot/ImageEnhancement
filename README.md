# ImageEnhancement
Image enhancement is an important task in image processing, which aims to improve the visual quality 
of images by reducing noise, improving contrast, and enhancing details. In this project, we will explore
two approaches for image enhancement: traditional image processing techniques and a pretrained model 
called MirNet using Deep Learning.

## Importing Libraries
### The necessary libraries are imported for image processing and evaluation metrics. The libraries used include:

os: for file and directory operations

cv2: for image processing tasks

numpy: for array manipulation

PIL: for image manipulation
skimage: for image processing and evaluation metrics
sklearn: for evaluation metrics
matplotlib: for visualization
